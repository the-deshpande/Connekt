## Influencer Sponsorship Platform

### Problem Statement

It is a platform to connect Sponsors and influencers so that sponsors can get their product/service advertised and influencers can get monetary benefit.

### My approach

For this, I implemented a website with frontend using Vue3 and backend with flask. I believe that it fulfilled all the needs of the skeleton on the website intended. I began with building a rough sketch of pages in the frontend and slowly built the corresponding logic in the backend along with it. Step by step building the backend apis and the frontend for each page accordingly. The interactions between tables have been shown below in the ER Diagram.
